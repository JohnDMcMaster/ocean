.TH SDFWRITEALL 3SDF "THE SEADIF PROGRAMMERS MANUAL"
.SH NAME
sdfwriteallcir, sdfwritealllay \- functions for updating
and creating a hierarchical tree of cells in a seadif data base.
.SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <sealib.h>

 int sdfwriteallcir(long what, CIRCUITPTR circuit)
 int sdfwritealllay(long what, LAYOUTPTR layout)

.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions write the attributes specified in the parameter "what" to the
data base for the specified cell and for all its children. If any such
attribute already exists it is overwritten. The legal values for "what" are
described in
.IR sdfread (3SDF).

The functions operate by repeatedly calling sdfwrite. They also administrate
which cells have been written, so that multiple instances of the same cell only
account for a single write operation.
.SH "WARNING"
For their own convenience, the functions sdfwriteallcir() and sdfwritealllay()
modify bit 15 (0x8000) of layout->flag.l and all its children.
