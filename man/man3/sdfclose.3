.TH SDFCLOSE 3SDF "THE SEADIF PROGRAMMERS MANUAL"
.SH NAME
sdfclose \- function to close a seadif data base.
.SH SYNOPSIS
 void sdfclose(void)

.SH DESCRIPTION
This function closes a seadif data base. If some cells had been written with
any of the functions described in
.IR sdfwrite (3SDF)
then these write actions will only now update the data base. Consequently, if
you forget to call sdfclose (or if your program fails to do so because of a
crash), the data base remains unaffected. It just stays as it was when you
opened it with sdfopen().
