.SH NAME
sdfmakeshapef \- Seadif call to install the shape function in a CIRCUIT structure.
.SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <sealib.h>

 int sdfmakeshapef(CIRCUITPTR circuit);

.SH DESCRIPTION
This function reads the bounding boxes of all layouts associated with a circuit
and then computes the shape function for that circuit. The result is a linear
list of structures of type SHAPEF (defined in libstruct.h). The bbx fields in
the list consist of strictly monotonously increasing bbx[HOR] values and
strictly monotonously decreasing bbx[VER] values.

A successful call to sdfmakeshapef returns the shape function in
circuit->shapef. It also leaves the list of layouts in the field
circuit->layout.  Sdfmakeshapef only reads the layout bounding boxes (the bbx
field in the LAYOUT structure), so only this minimal amount of information will
be present in the list of layouts --unless you read more layout information
yourself.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
A successful call to sdfmakeshapef returns TRUE. On failure it returns NIL. If
no layout information is available for the circuit it still returns TRUE, but
the circuit->shapef field is left untouched.
