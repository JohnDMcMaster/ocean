.SH NAME
sdftouch \- functions to set the modification date of a seadif object.
.SH SYNOPSIS

 #include <sealib.h>

 int sdftouchlay(LAYOUTPTR   lay, time_t timestamp);
 int sdftouchcir(CIRCUITPTR  cir, time_t timestamp);
 int sdftouchlib(LIBRARYPTR  lib, time_t timestamp);
 int sdftouchfun(FUNCTIONPTR fun, time_t timestamp);

.SH DESCRIPTION
If the named seadif object does not yet exist in the database it is created,
similar to sdfwrite(3SDF), and the modification date in the Status field is
set to
.IR timestamp .

If the named seadif object already exists in the database, then
.I sdftouch
sets the modification date of the object to
.IR timestamp .
Because of run time efficiency, this modifiction date is not written to the
seadif database.
As a consequence, the programmer must call
.IR sdfwrite (3SDF)
before closing the database, otherwise the call to
.I sdftouch
has no effect.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
These functions return TRUE if the date could be set, NIL otherwise.
