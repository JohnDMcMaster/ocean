.SH NAME
sdfremovelib, sdfremovefun, sdfremovecir, sdfremovelay \- functions that
remove an object from the Seadif library.
.SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <sealib.h>

 public int sdfremovelib(STRING libname)

 public int sdfremovefun(STRING funname, STRING libname)

 public int sdfremovecir(STRING cirname, STRING funname,
                         STRING libname)

 public int sdfremovelay(STRING layname, STRING cirname,
                         STRING funname, STRING libname)

.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions remove the named object from the seadf database. The removal
only takes place when
.IR sdfclose (3SDF)
is called. Until that time,
.I sdfremove
does not prevent the programmer from accessing a cell that has been "removed".
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The functions return TRUE for success and NIL for failure.
.SH WARNING
As usual, the argument strings of these functions must be canonic, see
.IR cs (3SDF).
