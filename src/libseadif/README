Compilation for Sparc/SunOs-4.1.1 with GNU gcc-2.1.1:
=====================================================

The problem here is that the /usr/include tree does not contain any ANSI
prototypes. In systypes.h I had to add "#define KERNEL" because the non-ANSI
function declarations in the header files are sometimes #ifdef'd KERNEL. This
of course is a horrible hack, and I don't think it will help us in many other
versions of SunOs. What we **really** need from Sun is ANSI-C with ANSI header
files.

The shell command that does the job is:
% make OCEAN=/usr/ocean \
       CC=gcc \
       XCFLAGS="-fno-builtin -O" \
       XLYCFLAGS="-U__GNUC__" \
       install
