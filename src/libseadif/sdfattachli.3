.TH SDFATTACHLIB 3SDF "SEADIF PROGRAMMERS MANUAL"
.SH NAME
sdfattachlib \- bind a seadif library to a specific file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
 #include <sealib.h>

 int sdfattachlib(LIBRARYPTR lib, char *filename)
 
.SH DESCRIPTION
During normal sealib operation, calling this function should never be
necessary. However, it is provided to give the sophisticated user (i.e. hackers
and the like) enhanced control over the seadif data base.
Sdfattachlib() moves the named library from the file it is currently in to the
named file. However, the move only takes effect when the data base is closed
with
.IR sdfclose (3SDF).

If filename does not start with a '/' or with './' sdfattachlib prepends the
value of the environment variable NEWSEADIR to filename.
If NEWSEADIR is not set nothing is prepended.

For this time only, the filename parameter can be an ordinary character string
and is not required to be canonic.
.SH WARNING
If you attach a library to a seadif file that was not opened with
.IR sdfopen (3SDF)
sdfattachlib currently refuses to overwrite the file.
