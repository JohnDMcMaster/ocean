The OCEAN tools are a central component in the 'fishbone' Sea-of-Gates
design trajectory. This trajectory covers the design from circuit level to a
physical chip. All software and design effort for this trajectory was
performed 'in house' at Delft University of Technology, department of
electrical engineering. The following people contibuted to the trajectory:

 ** The software **
Circuit tools 'sls' 'simeye':  Arjan van Genderen 
Extractor 'space':             Nick van der Meijs
Ocean placer 'Madonna':        Paul Stravers and Irek Karkowski
Ocean router 'trout':          Patrick Groeneveld
Layout editor 'seadali':       Patrick Groeneveld (based on nelsis 'dali')
Purifiers 'fish'and 'ghoti':   Patrick Groeneveld and Paul Stravers
Database support (seadif):     Paul Stravers and Patrick Groeneveld
Database support (Nelsis3):    Nick v/d Meijs, Paul Stravers, Patrick Groeneveld
Database support (Nelsis4):    Alfred van der Hoeven and Pieter van der Wolf
Nelsis backbone system:        Legacy of many people
Overall software Coordination: Patrick Groeneveld
