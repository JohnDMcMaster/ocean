CRUISE - INSTALLATION NOTES:
---------------------------


You can compile this program only if you've installed Interviews graphic
library version 3.1. It probably works also with earlier versions but it
hasn't been tested.

You probably have to make small changes in the Makefile to set c++ compiler's
type you use and define some system paths. This version of Makefile is mend for
Gnu g++ v.2.3.3 and HP hppa1.1 (hppa1.0) machine. You
also may want to change a path to the place where Interviews are installed on
your system. Default is /usr/local/interviews .


Certainly before you start you have to define several system variables as it is
usually done with other Ocean applications. The only extension is CPU variable
which should be defined to the same name as has been used when compiling
Interviews. Use gnumake. 


To compile and install type :

gnumake -f Makefile install

If you want to customize the appearance of the windows add following
definitions to your .Xdefaults file:

cruise*background:      white
