Sep. 22, 1999
-------------

Features compared to earlier distributions:
  
   - Seadali now also runs when it can allocate only a 
     reduced set of colors. (In the past, this caused
     that seadali could not be used at all on some
     screens.)
   - The maximum length of cell, instance, terminal 
     and net names has been increased from 14 to 256.
   - Net names are now used by trout to create labels
     in the layout.  As a result, the extracted circuit
     will have the same net (node) names as the original
     circuit.
   - Introduced an installation script 'ocean_install'.

Source code of this new OCEAN distribution is currently
not available.   The old OCEAN distribution is available 
from ftp://cas.et.tudelft.nl/pub/ocean.old.
