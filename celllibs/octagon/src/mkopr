# This script is to be sourced by ICELLS. It creates a nelsis project directory
# and imports the libraries "primitives", "oplib1_93" and "bonding" into that
# project.
#
# This script assumes that the following have been set by ICELLS:
#         $PROJECT  (the full path name of the project to be created)
#         $BINLIBS  (the full path to the directory containing the
#                    binary version of the libraries)
#         $SRCLIBS  (the full path to the directory containing the ascii version
#                    of the libraries, as well as the template directory)
#
#
# First set some parameters ...
#
LIB_PRIM=primitives
LIB_OP=octalib3_93
SRC_TEMPL=templ1_93
#
# And now for the real work ...
#
echo ------- creating $OCEANPROCESS project $PROJECT -------

echo ------- importing $LIB_PRIM -------

echo ------- importing $LIB_OP -------

echo ------- copying default config files -------
cp $SRCLIBS/$SRC_TEMPL/.??* $PROJECT   # copy the default dot files
cp $SRCLIBS/$SRC_TEMPL/*    $PROJECT   # copy the external declarations etc.

# We did it!
