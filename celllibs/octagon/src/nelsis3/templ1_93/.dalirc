# Welcome message

# turn off none of the masks
# visible pp off

#
# link the contact masks which contact to poly/diffusion
# in this way these masks will always switch on or off together
# linkmasks cop con cps

#
# for convenience: turn layer metal1 on
layer in on 

#
# when reading a new cell: automatically expand until the bottom

#
# Could draw all instances hashed, to indicate level
hashed off

# 
# start drawing dominant (better for SoG structure)
dominant on

# 
# Turn on image mode: 
# auto-snap all instances to grid during move or add
imagemode on

# 
# switch the tracker window on
tracker on

#
# Display the grid
grid on

#
# Do not display the instances of the 'primitives' library
# during an 'add_imp'
weedout primitives

#
# Set drawing order for dominant drawing
# The layer with the lowest number will be drawn last
# All missing layers will be drawn transparent, UNDER the dominant layers

# for checking we need flat expansion

#
# set instance name of the image, for special treatment by
# seadali (default: IMAGE)
# imagename IMAGE

# set the maximum number of image cells which should be drawn on the
# screen, to prevent endless drawing (default: 120)
maxdraw 21

# set the cell name, using which seadali can detect whether this is
# a via. Vianames will not be drawn. Only the first 3 characters are
# significant. (Default: via)

# If you like, you can use more commands, or even run a 'slide show'
# by putting commands in this file
# The following tokens can be used:
# label <l>                   set return label (for looping)
# goto <l>                    goto label l
# print <text>                print out text in dali
# sleep <secs>                wait for secs time
# beep                        beep (^G in output file)
# read <cell>                 read specified cell
# redraw                      redraw screen
# wdw_bbx                     full view
# zoom <x> <y> <fraction>     zoom with x, y as center and fraction part of cell
# center <x> <y>              center window on x,y
# expand <level>              set expansion level
# default_expansion <level>   set default expansion when reading cell
# visible <layer> [on/off]    turn layer visible/invisible
# layer <layer> [on/off]      (de-)activate layer for drawing
# order <layer> <prio>        set drawing order of layer
# append <xl> <xr> <yb> <yt>  append in current masks
# delete <xl> <xr> <yb> <yt>  delete in current masks
# dominant [on/off]           enable/disable dominant drawing
# hashed [on/off]             draw instances hashed
# imagename <inst_name>       set inst name of SoG image
# vianame <cell_name>         set cell name of vias
# maxdraw <num>               draw at most num instances of the image
