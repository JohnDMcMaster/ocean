		       About the 'fishbone' libraries
		       ==============================

This directory contains the set of libraries which we have for basic design on
the 'fishbone' Sea-of-Gates chip at Delft University of Technology. The
following project directories (= NELSIS libraries) are included:

primitives:
	Contains the primitive (minimal) set of cells which must be included in
        each [project you make. It contains the basic fishbone image, the via
	patterns, and other lementary cells.

oplib1_93:
	Contains the basic cell library (version of january 1993). The library
	was developed for a practical course (the OP) a Delft University. 
	Therefore it doesn't contain fancy complicated cells. It is, however,
	sufficient for most applications.

bonding:
	Contains a set of bonding patterns to finish the designs on a 
	multi-project chip.

chip:	
	Contains the chip which we have at Delft University of Technology,
	uncluding the bonding pads and other peculatities.

templ1_93:
	Template of an empty project directory for an average user. The 
	project imports the proper cells from the libraries 'primitives',
	'oplib1_93' and 'bonding'. It also contains the proper startup and
	customization files for vaious tools.

the file LIBRARIES:
        the generation file for the cell/chip

The directory 'celllibs/fishbone/src' contains the ascii source files from
which the NELSIS libraries can be compiled using the scrip ICELLS. This
'compilation' is necessary because some library files are machine dependent, or
dependent on the position in the file system. You cannot just move a directory
to a different place.
