This tutorial contains examples on using the SIS logic synthesis with ocean.
Two examples are provided:

    hotel.kiss2    Hotel tutorial example, with 1 button input
    three.kiss2    Hotel turorial example with three buttons input

To facilitate easy use of SIS with OCEAN, the program 'kissis' performing
this entire FSM synthesis trajectory for you. The format of the input table is
simple. It basically declares the number inputs and outputs, and state
transition conditions. The file hotel.kiss2 contains the hotel example
of the 'hotel' tutorial, but now described in SIS format. 

now just type:

   /users/neuzeltje % kissis hotel

to synthesize the entire hotel circuit.

The inputs and outputs are numbered: 

    IN_0 is the button input
    IN_1 is the freeze signal
    OUT_0 is the lamp output
    R is the reset for the flip-flops

To avoid problems with undefined flipflop states in SLS, the program kiss2cir
instructs SIS to use the resettable flip-flop dfr11. The reset-signals of the
flip-flops are automatically connected to the terminal 'R' of hotel. In this
way you can force the FSM to a known state at the beginning of the simulation.

As next step you generate the layout using Madonna and Trout. This process --
from table all the way dows to a sea-of-gates layout -- is a remarkably fast
and produces high-quality results!


The circuit 'three' is essentially the same, except that is has three inputs
instead of one.
