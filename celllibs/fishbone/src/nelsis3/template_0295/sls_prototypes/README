         *** ABOUT the directory 'sls_prototypes' ***

This directory contains the external definitions for all library cells which
are distributed with the OCEAN package.  Why? Well.., if you use 'csls' to
enter you circuit in the database, csls needs the external definitions of all
instances which you use in the file. This was done delibrately to help you to
take care of the proper connection of the terminals (have a look at the file
../.sls_mkdbrc for more details on this subject). 

This directory contains one file per library. Each file contains the external
network description of the circuits cells in that library in sls format. Using
the command #include<extfile_name> you can include these external definitions
into your sls-file. 

The file "oplib.ext" includes the (current/latest) version of all libraries for
the op practicum. Example of the use in an sls-file:

    #include<oplib.ext>
    network neuzel (terminal a, b, c)
    {
    .....network description....
    }
