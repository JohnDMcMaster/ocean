# turn off visibility of some nasty masks: od, sn, sp, nw, cb, bb

# in thsi way these masks will always switch on or off together

# draw all instances hashed, to indicate level

# start drawing dominant (better for SoG structure)

# The layer with the lowest number will be drawn last

# set the maximum number of image cells which should be drawn on the
