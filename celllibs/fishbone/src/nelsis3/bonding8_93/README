		       About the cell library "bonding"
		       ================================

This library contains the bonding patterns for the fishbone chip.  It currently
contains seven cells which which are useful for finishing the design at the 
highest level. To place the design on the final chip, these bonding patterns fit
presisely to make a multi-project chip (in library 'chip').

The bonding cells span up the area for the design. They also specify the exact
terminal locations.

The cell 'bond_leer' is used by the students to place their exercise cell in.
They have to finish the name of the group in the upper parts.  Each 'bond_leer'
should be isolated from its neighbours. To enforce this there are in/ins (=
metal1 and metal2) borders around the cell. The repetition of the 'bond_leer'
cell on the final chip should be [136,84] grid points.

The other cells are the bonding patterns for multi-project chip. For a division
into 4 projects of equal size, use the following:

bondNoordOost  bondZuidOost
bondNoordWest  bondZuidWest

For a division into two bigger parts, use 

bondNoord and bondZuid

These subciruits can be placed in the chip. The result should be the
following hierarchical tree:

...and for another thing: what the hack means ZuidOost ???? OK kids, do we all
speak our dutch? Here comes Lesson 1:

Zullen we naar de kroeg gaan?	-- Shall we go to the pub?
Wil je met me dansen?		-- Would you like to dance with me?
Woon je in Amsterdam-West?      -- Do you live in the west of Amsterdam?
Woon je in Amsterdam-Oost?      -- Do you live in the east of Amsterdam?
Woon je in Amsterdam-Noord?     -- Do you live in the north of Amsterdam?
Woon je in Amsterdam-Zuid?      -- Do you live in the south of Amsterdam?
Woon je aan de rand van A'dam?  -- Do you live at the border of Amsterdam?
Ik leer al Nederlands!		-- I'm already learning dutch!

If you'd like to go on with Lesson 2, mail me at stravers@donau.et.tudelft.nl.
